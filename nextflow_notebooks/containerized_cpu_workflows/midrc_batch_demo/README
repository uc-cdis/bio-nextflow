The first of the two MIDRC CPU workflows (midrc_download_dcm_conda.ipynb) can be run on its own and will download
MIDRC dicom files to your workspace. The second workflow (midrc_cpu_batch_demo.ipynb) is run on the cloud and will
convert the dicom files from the first workflow to png files, extract metadata from the dicom files, and save the
results of these two processes to your local workspace. The second workflow requires you to build a compatible workflow
container.

To build the container, please run the docker build command on the Dockerfile, in the same directory where all the model
files, code, Dockerfile and requirements.txt file lives. Then push the container to Gen3 staging by requesting
credentials, get it approved and receive a docker URI to plug into the nextflow workflow.

To run the container in the nextflow workflow, paste the approved docker URI received from Gen3 in the "container"
section of the nextflow config. This lives in the nextflow workflow notebook (midrc_cpu_batch_demo.ipynb).
Run the notebook in BRH to deploy the container on AWS batch. Note: all the "placeholder" values in the notebook will
need to be replaced with values specific to your workspace. These come pre-populated with the workspace, please see the
"Nextflow welcome" page for more details and copy the sample config values onto your nextflow config.
